                    <p>
                        This paper examines the recent trends in marriage rates in the U.S. from 2000 to 2021, focusing on the role of wage structure and work hours explaining these changes.
                        Using IPUMS data, I show that the wage structure changed as well as a significant reduction in work hours for men across all income groups, with a slight increase for women.
                        This study highlights that work hours, not just wages, significantly influence marriage patterns.
                        The analysis finds that reductions in male work hours may increase marriage probability, suggesting that time availability is a crucial factor in household dynamics.
                        A marriage model calibrated to 2000 and tested with 2021 data supports the hypothesis that changes in work hours better explain recent marriage trends than changes in wages.
                        This paper contributes to understanding economic determinants of marriage by emphasizing the critical role of work hours.

                    <b>Does Public Education Hurt the Middle Class? </b>  <br>
                </p>

                        In this paper, we construct a model in which individuals decide between private and public education.
                        We study the effect of this decision on income inequality.
                        In particular, we analyze the effect of three policies on the middle class, namely: an increase in government spending on public education, an increase in income tax, and an improvement in the productivity of public education.
                        Our main finding is that increasing government spending on public education reduces the future income of the middle class by prompting parents in this group to opt out of private education.

                        This project explores how artificial intelligence technologies are influencing employment opportunities and wages across different sectors. Using panel data from multiple countries, the research aims to estimate the elasticity of substitution between human labor and AI-driven automation, focusing on the disparity in impacts among low-skill versus high-skill occupations. Preliminary findings suggest that industries with rapid AI adoption are experiencing both job displacement and the creation of new skill-intensive roles.

                        This work examines how technological advances are transforming education policy. It assesses how public spending on technology in schools affects student outcomes, particularly in underfunded districts. A structural model of education investment is being developed to evaluate different policy interventions and their long-term impact on skill acquisition and economic productivity.
